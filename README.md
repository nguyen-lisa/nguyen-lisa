## 🚀 About Me

🖌️ I turn ideas into clean, accessible designs in Figma and bring them to life in code.
💻 I build with React, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create responsive, keyboard-navigable UIs.
🎨 Tailwind CSS is my go-to for rapid, maintainable styling.
♿ I believe good design is inclusive design, accessibility is not optional, it is fundamental.

I regularly audit and refine experiences using Lighthouse and axe DevTools to catch accessibility issues early in the design and development process.

## 🌱 Currently Exploring

♿ Deepening accessibility expertise with WCAG, AODA requirements, and robust ARIA patterns.
🐍 Learning Python for web scraping and automation to expand my technical toolkit.
🔧 Building Chrome extensions and experimenting with browser APIs.
🎯 Exploring design systems and component libraries for scalable, consistent UI architectures.
📚 Strengthening Git workflows and contributing to open-source projects.
